# numpy-for-python-2.7-64bit
Numpy packages built to link against Python 2.7 64bit

A loooong time ago, sometime in the early late 2000's, Autodesk added Python 2.7 as a scripting languages to Maya. Around the same time Maya started to ship as a 64bit application. Because Python 2.7 was officially released as 32bit, this meant that official python package with binary dependencies could not work in Maya unless they were compiled for Python 2.7-64bit.

Over the years I compiled and maintained several versions of numpy, and shared them freely with Maya's community. It's been a great pleasure to see how it enabled TAs around the world in crafting incredible tools powered by numpy's powerful numeric applications.

This github repo represents a historical resting place for the last versions I compiled:

- Numpy 1.13.1 + intel mkl libraries
- Scipy 0.19.1
