# numpy-for-python-2.7-64bit
Numpy packages built to link against Python 2.7 64bit

A loooong time ago, sometime in the early late 2000's, Autodesk added Python 2.7 as a scripting languages to Maya. 

Around the same time, Maya started to ship as a 64 bit application. Because Python 2.7 was officially released as 32 bit, this meant that official python packages with binary dependencies could not work in Maya natively, unless they were compiled specifically for a customized build of Python 2.7.

Over the years I compiled and maintained several versions of Numpy, and shared them freely with Maya's community. It's been a great pleasure to see how it enabled TAs around the world in crafting incredible tools powered by numpy's powerful numeric applications.

This github repo represents a historical resting place for the last versions I compiled and shared:

- Numpy 1.13.1 + Intel mkl libraries
- Scipy 0.19.1
