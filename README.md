# numpy-for-python-2.7-64bit
[Over the years I maintained several custom versions of Numpy compiled for Maya's 64 bit cut of Python 2.7.](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/maya-programming/numpy-1-13-1-scipy-0-19-1-for-maya-2018/m-p/7362541/highlight/true#M6395)

I shared these builds freely with Maya's community which enabled TAs around the world in crafting incredible tools powered by numpy's powerful numeric applications. This github repo represents a historical resting place for the last versions I compiled and shared:

- Numpy 1.13.1 + Intel mkl libraries
- Scipy 0.19.1
